# 🎮 Microtransaction Economy in CS:GO: A Behavioral & Econometric Analysis

> 📊 An exploration of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) marketplace, focused on transactional behavior, price dynamics, and update-driven player interactions.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project analyzes the **CS:GO Steam Community Market (SCM)** to understand how item prices, game updates, and social drivers (streamers/events) influence **microtransaction behavior**.

- **Course**: Game Studies & Virtual Economies (Master-level elective)
- **Dataset**: 5GB+ Kaggle dataset on item transactions
- **Approach**: Regression modeling with log transformations, outlier adjustments, and behavioral theory application

---

## 🧠 My Role

I was responsible for:
- Conducting the **entire analytical process**, from **cleaning to modeling**
- Handling **100M+ data points** across multiple item categories
- Building and interpreting the **regression models** with econometric checks
- Writing the full **analysis & insights sections**
- Delivering the findings through presentations and visual walkthroughs

> **Note**: I did **not** write the introduction, literature review, or academic framing — my focus was on the **data, analysis, and conclusions**.

## 📊 Methodology Highlights

- **Focus Item**: AK-47 skin category (representative of CS:GO item economy)
- **Techniques**:
  - Log transformation of monetary variables
  - Outlier removal for rare “legendary” items
  - Regression diagnostics: autocorrelation, multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity
  - Lag variables to handle residual autocorrelation

- **Behavioral Drivers Included**:
  - Game updates (date-marked events)
  - Streaming peaks (e.g., Twitch spikes)
  - Patch cycles and major tournaments

---

## 🔎 Key Results

- **Price only explains ~29%** of microtransaction volume (R² ≈ 0.2878)
- Events had **minimal direct effect**, but **updates drive future economic activity**
- Regression models show **streamer influence & skin price changes** affect transaction behavior
- **Ecosystem behavior** identified: developers, streamers, players all fueling the loop

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- R (regression modeling & diagnostics)
- Excel (manual data integration)
- AI-assisted scraping & point generation from image graphs
- Kaggle (raw dataset: CS:GO transactions)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This was a **group project**, but all **data analysis, regression modeling, and interpretations** were my work. Introductory sections were co-written or led by teammates.
